<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Respect for privacy and data protection is a core principle. Any personal information
shared through contact forms, emails, messaging platforms, project discussions, or
service inquiries—including names, email addresses, project details, and technical
requirements—is collected solely for communication, project evaluation, collaboration,
and service delivery purposes.
</p>

<p>
Such information is never sold, rented, or shared with third parties for advertising,
marketing, or unrelated activities.
</p>

<p>
Data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the intended purpose or to
comply with legal or contractual obligations. Reasonable technical and organizational
measures are implemented to safeguard personal data against unauthorized access,
alteration, disclosure, or loss.
</p>

<p>
However, no digital transmission or storage method can be guaranteed to be completely
secure, and users acknowledge this inherent risk.
</p>

<p>
By communicating or engaging in services, users consent to the collection and use of
their information as described in this policy. Users may request clarification,
correction, or deletion of their personal data at any time, subject to applicable legal
requirements.
</p>

<p>
Continued use of this application signifies acceptance of this copyright and privacy
policy.
